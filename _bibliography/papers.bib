  abstract={Hereditary cardiomyopathies are the prototypic forms of heart failure and major causes of sudden cardiac death. The genome in cardiomyopathies is exposed to internal stressors, which damage the DNA and activate the DNA damage response (DDR) pathways. We set to determine whether the DDR pathways were activated and pathogenic in an established mouse model of desmoplakin (DSP)-cardiomyopathy generated upon deletion of the Dsp gene in cardiac myocytes (Myh6-McmTam:DspF/F). The mice exhibited premature death, cardiac dysfunction, myocardial cell death, fibrosis, and increased expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, consistent with the phenotype of human DSP-cardiomyopathy. Cytosolic nuclear self-DNA (nDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were increased in cardiac myocyte cytosol in the Myh6-McmTam:DspF/F mice. Likewise, the DDR pathway proteins, including the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (CGAS), stimulator of interferon response 1 (STING1) were upregulated as were the transcript levels of interferon response factor 3 (IRF3) and the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) target genes. Deletion of the Mb21d1 gene encoding CGAS in the Myh6-McmTam:DspF/F mice prolonged survival, improved cardiac function, attenuated fibrosis, and reduced cell death. Thus, cytosolic nDNA and mtDNA are increased and the DDR pathways are activated and pathogenic in a mouse model of DSP-cardiomyopathy, whereas genetic blockade of CGAS is salubrious.},

  title={The cGAS/STING Pathway: Friend or Foe in Regulating Cardiomyopathy},
  author={Wang, Weiyue and Gao, Yuanxu and Lee, Hyun Kyoung and Yu, Albert Cheung-Hoi and Kipp, Markus and Kaddatz, Hannes and Zhan, Jiangshan},
  abstract={Inflammation is a central hallmark of cardiomyopathy, where misdirected immune responses contribute to chronic myocardial dysfunction. Among the emerging molecular mechanisms implicated in this process, the cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway has garnered increasing attention. Acting as a key cytosolic DNA sensor, the cGAS/STING pathway orchestrates inflammatory responses triggered by microbial infections or endogenous cellular stressors such as autophagy and apoptosis. Despite its pivotal role, the precise molecular mechanisms regulating this pathway and its role in cardiomyopathy-associated inflammation remain poorly understood and subject to ongoing debate. To address this scientific gap, we first reviewed key findings on cGAS/STING signaling in various forms of cardiomyopathy, drawing from in vivo and in vitro studies, as well as clinical samples. In the next step, we explored how the cGAS/STING pathway could be modulated by specific agonists and antagonists in the context of cardiac disease. Finally, by integrating publicly available human single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data and a systematic literature review, we identified existing molecular interventions and highlighted promising therapeutic targets aimed at mitigating cGAS/STING-driven inflammation. This comprehensive approach emphasizes the therapeutic potential of targeting the cGAS/STING pathway and provides a foundation for developing novel interventions aimed at alleviating inflammatory cardiomyopathy and improving patient outcomes. Future studies will be essential to validate these findings and facilitate their translation into clinical practice.},

  title={Large-scale proteomics data reveal integrated prognosis-related protein signatures and role of SMAD4 and RAD50 in prognosis and immune infiltrations of prostate cancer microenvironment},

  abstract={As prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, identifying potential prognostic biomarkers is crucial. In this study, the survival information, gene expression, and protein expression data of 344 PCa cases were collected from the Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to investigate the potential prognostic biomarkers. The integrated prognosis-related proteins (IPRPs) model was constructed based on the risk score of each patients using machine-learning algorithm. IPRPs model suggested that Elevated RAD50 expression (p = 0.016) and down-regulated SMAD4 expression (p = 0.017) were significantly correlated with unfavorable outcomes for PCa patients. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and western blot (WB) analysis revealed significant differential expression of SMAD4 and RAD50 protein between tumor and normal tissues in validation cohort. According to the overall IHC score, patients with low SMAD4 (p < 0.0001) expression and high RAD50 expression (p = 0.0001) were significantly correlated with poor outcomes. Besides, expression of SMAD4 showed significantly negative correlation with most immune checkpoint molecules, and the low SMAD4 expression group exhibited significantly high levels of LAG3 (p < 0.05), TGFβ (p < 0.001), and PD-L1 (p < 0.05) compared with the high SMAD4 expression group in the validation cohort. Patients with low SMAD4 expression had significantly higher infiltration of memory B cells (p = 0.002), CD8 + T cells (p < 0.001), regulatory T cells (p = 0.006), M2-type macrophages (p < 0.001), and significantly lower infiltration of naïve B cells (p = 0.002), plasma cells (p < 0.001), resting memory CD4 + T cells (p < 0.001) and eosinophils (p = 0.045). Candidate proteins were mainly involved in antigen processing and presentation, stem cell differentiation, and type I interferon pathways.},
